## Overview

### The project

A collaborative attempt at creating a Mad Libs Word Game as part of the Chingu Voyage program, following the Agile Methodology and the Minimum Viable Product(MVP). The game consists of one player prompting a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See focus and hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View a Madlib story after submitting a valid data through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - Any field has profane words
- Download or Print their story
