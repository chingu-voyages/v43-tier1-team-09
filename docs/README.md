## Overview

### The project

A collaborative attempt at creating a Mad Libs Word Game as part of the Chingu Voyage program, following the Agile Methodology and the Minimum Viable Product(MVP). The game consists of one player prompting a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See focus and hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View a Madlib story after submitting a valid data through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - Any field has profane words
- Download or Print their story

### Project Setup

The first step we took as a team was to create the required files for our project and ways to connect them. To organize, we did a simple Google search that led us to stories of different genres and scenarios, also with placeholders that would be used as input for adjectives, nouns, or a person's name. In our file, these placeholders were delimited by double brackets in camelcase _(ie. {{placeholder}} )_.

Therefore, the second step after organizing all these stories in a single CSV file separated by categories, size, and placeholders, was to convert the CSV to a JSON file. Once open, we use a for loop to go over each JSON object of the file. The first loop identified all the placeholder variables in a given scenario. Those variables are stored in the var*list array. In the second loop, each variable is split into a list of words *(ie. "aTypeOfBuilding" becomes ["a","Type","Of","Building"])_ and then converted into a string variable _(ie. the list["a","Type","Of","Building"] becomes the string "A type of building")\_. Those variables are then stored in the description_array.

Finally, both lists are zipped into a **Python** dictionary, converted, and added to their corresponding Scenario object. The resulting Scenario object is stored in a final array. The final array is saved in the stories.json file, and then we can use it as a component for replacing in the DOM.
