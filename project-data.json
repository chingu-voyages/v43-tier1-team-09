      "reason": "This project actually has a very cool but slow Easter Egg effect occuring each second. There is a hue-rotate animation happening at a snail's pace. Leave the page open for a while and you'll see the colors change. But apart from this less aparent effect there is a simple but playful color scheme going on to emerge the user in an experience that is fun and engaging. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the fonts are easy to read. The overall design is clean and modern, with a focus on usability and user experience. The color scheme is consistent throughout the site, with a purple, pink, gold, and blue palette that is visually appealing and easy on the eyes. The fonts are also consistent, with a mix of Roboto, monospace, and sans-serif fonts that are easy to read and complement the overall design. The design is simple and intuitive, with clear navigation and interactive elements that are easy to use. Overall, the visual identification of the site is clean, modern, and user-friendly. There is a healthy mix of interactivity and randomness in the background to entertain the user. ",

    "challenge_solution": {
      "challenge": "The obvious challenge we faced was implementing the Madlib generation feature, which required us to create a form that could accept user input and generate a story based on the data provided. We overcame this challenge by creating a form that could accept user input and generate a story based on the data provided. We also implemented a validation system to ensure that users could only submit valid data, preventing errors and ensuring a seamless user experience. This was the easy part. We did not have a Product Owner or a Scrum Master on board and it was also the first time for most of us to be working on a project on a team. We had to learn how to work together as a team, communicate effectively, and manage our time efficiently to meet our deadlines. We also had to learn how to use new tools and technologies, such as Figma, Python, and Webpack, which added to the complexity of the project.",
      "solution": "The solution that I came up with was to jump in as the Product Owner and learn what it took to manage a team. Luckily I already had some skills in leadership and group dynamics so that was to my advantage. The team was very supportive and we all worked together to overcome the challenges we faced. We communicated regularly, held daily stand-up meetings, and used Github Projects to track our progress and manage our tasks. We also divided the work into smaller tasks and assigned them to team members based on their skills and expertise. This helped us to work more efficiently and meet our deadlines. We then used pair programming and code reviews to ensure that the code was ready for production. Overall, I believe that the key to our success was effective communication, collaboration, and teamwork. By working together and supporting each other, we were able to overcome the challenges we faced and deliver a high-quality product that met the requirements of the Voyage program. I am proud of what we accomplished and grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented and dedicated team."
