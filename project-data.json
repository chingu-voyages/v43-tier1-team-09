    "challenge_solution": {
      "challenge": "The obvious challenge we faced was implementing the Madlib generation feature, which required us to create a form that could accept user input and generate a story based on the data provided. We overcame this challenge by creating a form that could accept user input and generate a story based on the data provided. We also implemented a validation system to ensure that users could only submit valid data, preventing errors and ensuring a seamless user experience. This was the easy part. We did not have a Product Owner or a Scrum Master on board and it was also the first time for most of us to be working on a project on a team. We had to learn how to work together as a team, communicate effectively, and manage our time efficiently to meet our deadlines. We also had to learn how to use new tools and technologies, such as Figma, Python, and Webpack, which added to the complexity of the project. Despite these challenges, we were able to successfully complete the project and deliver a high-quality product that met the requirements of our stakeholders.",
      "solution": "The solution that I came up with was to jump in as the Product Owner and learn what it took to manage a team. Luckily I already had some skills in leadership and group dynamics so that was to my advantage. The team was very supportive and we all worked together to overcome the challenges we faced. We communicated regularly, held daily stand-up meetings, and used Github Projects to track our progress and manage our tasks. We also divided the work into smaller tasks and assigned them to team members based on their skills and expertise. This helped us to work more efficiently and meet our deadlines. We also used pair programming and code reviews to ensure that the code was of high quality and met the requirements of our stakeholders. Overall, I believe that the key to our success was effective communication, collaboration, and teamwork. By working together and supporting each other, we were able to overcome the challenges we faced and deliver a high-quality product that met the requirements of the Voyage program. I am proud of what we accomplished and grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented and dedicated team."
