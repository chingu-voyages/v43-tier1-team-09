They have several adaptations that allow their wings to create lift and generate thrust, allowing them to stay in the air. The shape of bird wings is specially designed to produce lift as air moves over them, while the downward flapping motion produces thrust. The chest muscles in birds are strong, which helps them to power their flight. Birds also have hollow bones, reducing their overall weight, and making it easier for them to take off and stay aloft. Additionally, birds have a high metabolic rate, which allows them to generate enough energy needed for continuous flying.",

The production of this pigment is influenced by the pH level of the soil in which the rose plant grows.

In addition to anthocyanin, other pigments also contribute to the variety of colors seen in roses, including carotenoids {{yellow and orange}} and flavonols {{white and cream}}.
