# Chingu Voyage 43 - Tier 1 - Mad Libs Word Game

A collaborative attempt at creating a Mad Libs Word Game as part of the Chingu Voyage program. The goal of this project is not actually the finished project - but to experience getting there as a team. While getting there is the goal, there are certainly some Minimum Viable Product details that must be met. This project is to be built following Agile Principles using the SCRUM Framework. For most of us it is our first time with any experience like this so it is brand new. By the end of this project we should all be better developers and understand SCRUM and Agilie much better.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
live-server
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Install live-server globally if you haven't already

```
npm install live-server -g
```

Then launch the server

```
live-server
```

The page will render in a new window.

## Deployment

This site is just a static website with html, css, and js so it should not need to be deployed past hosting somewhere
