## Overview

Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. 
It consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks 
in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)

In Voyage 43 we want all Tier 1 teams to create a game, a Mad Libs word game to be more precise.
A Mad Libs game can be very simple, but it can also be as complex as you want it to be. Remember that 
the direction the team decides to go in, could determine if you are ready for Tier 2 in voyage 44.


## General Instructions

This project is designed to be worked on by a team rather than an individual
Chingu. This means you and your team will need to thoroughly read and
understand the requirements and specifications below, **_and_** define and
manage your project following the _Agile Methodology_ defined in the
[Voyage Handbook](https://chingucohorts.notion.site/Voyage-Guide-1e528dcbf1d241c9a93b4627f6f1c809).

As you create this project make sure it meets all of the requirements, but once
it reaches MVP start implementing the optional features or get creative and
extend it in ways we haven't envisioned. In other words, use the power of
teamwork to make it distinctive and unique.

Take note that we haven't given specific direction on what your UI/UX should
look like. This is another area where you and your team can put your creativity 
to work!
