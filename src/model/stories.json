    "Scenario": "Roses are red due to the presence of a pigment called anthocyanin. This pigment is responsible for giving the petals their red color. The production of this pigment is influenced by the pH level of the soil in which the rose plant grows. If the soil is acidic, the rose petals will be redder, while more alkaline conditions result in pink or white petals. In addition to anthocyanin, other pigments also contribute to the variety of colors seen in roses, including carotenoids {{yellowAndOrange}} and flavonols {{whiteAndCream}}. Overall, roses' red color is a result of a complex biochemical process stimulated by environmental factors.",

They spent hours adjusting the {{secondAdjective}}, {{color}} background, but CSS kept pushing it to the {{thirdAdjective}}, {{direction}}. In frustration, the developer exclaimed \"Why won't you work, you {{fourthAdjective}} stylesheet?!\" They eventually got it right, but not without a few {{fifthAdjective}}, {{bodyPart}} and a newfound respect for the power of CSS.",
